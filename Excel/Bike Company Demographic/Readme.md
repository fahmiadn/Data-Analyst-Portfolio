## Bike Company Order and Sales Analysis Project

This project involved analyzing order and sales data for a bike company using Excel, focusing on data preparation, cleaning, and visualization through an interactive dashboard to support data-driven insights. Key steps included:

#### Data Cleaning and Standardization:

Checked for and removed duplicates, extra spaces, and ensured there were no blank or null cells to maintain data integrity.
Standardized categorical values, such as converting abbreviations in the "Marital Status" and "Gender" columns to full forms (e.g., "M" to "Married").

#### Data Transformation:

Modified values in key columns to improve clarity, such as changing "Yes" to "Purchased" in the "PurchasedBike" column and removing unnecessary decimals in the "Income" column. Created additional columns like "Age Categories," "Has Children," and "Owns Car" to enable more detailed analysis and segmentation.

#### Interactive Dashboard Creation:

Developed an interactive dashboard that visually presents key metrics, trends, and customer insights, making the data more accessible for strategic decision-making.

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, and visualize data, providing valuable insights to support business goals and customer understanding.
