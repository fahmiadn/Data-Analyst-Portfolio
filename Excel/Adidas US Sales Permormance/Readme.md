## Adidas US Sales Analysis Project

In this project, I analyzed sales data for Adidas in the United States using Excel, with a focus on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to address key business questions. Key steps included:

#### Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicates, extra spaces, and corrected typos to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
Standardized formats, including date formats, to improve readability and streamline the analysis process.

#### Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables:

Leveraged pivot tables to address various business questions, gaining insights into sales performance, product trends, and customer demographics.

#### Interactive Dashboard Creation:

Developed an interactive dashboard to present findings in a visually engaging way, enabling stakeholders to explore the data and gain valuable insights quickly.

This project showcases my ability to clean and transform data, conduct in-depth analysis, and create visualizations that support data-driven decision-making.
