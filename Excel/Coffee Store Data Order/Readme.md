## Coffee Shop Order and Sales Analysis Project

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of order and sales data for a coffee shop, utilizing Excel for data handling and dashboard creation to enhance analytical insights. Key steps included:

Data Retrieval and Cleaning:

Employed functions like XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and IF to retrieve customer and product details and to clean data inconsistencies, such as replacing "0" with blank cells.
Data Transformation:

Calculated sales by multiplying quantities with unit prices, added new columns such as "Coffee Type Name" and "Roast Type Name" using conditional logic.
Applied specific formatting for units (e.g., kg for size, $ for prices) to enhance readability.
Data Validation:

Conducted checks for duplicates and removed unnecessary spaces to ensure data integrity.
Interactive Dashboard:

Designed an interactive dashboard to present key metrics and trends, providing a visually engaging experience for deeper analysis and decision-making.
This project highlights my ability to handle data from retrieval to transformation and visualization, making data-driven insights accessible and impactful for business stakeholders.
