### Netflix Movies Analysis Project

This project involved analyzing movie data released by Netflix, focusing on understanding genre trends and movie duration over time. Using Python, I conducted data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to answer key business questions. The main steps were:

Data Cleaning:

Adjusted data types for consistency, removed duplicates, and handled missing values to ensure a reliable dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Addressed specific business questions, such as:
Distribution of movie genres in the 1990s: Examined genre diversity and popularity during the decade.
Genres associated with long-duration films: Analyzed which genres tend to have longer durations and how duration varies across genres.
Duration trends in comedy films: Compared the duration distribution of comedy films to other genres over the past two decades.
Data Visualization:

Created visualizations to clearly present insights and patterns, enhancing the interpretability of the findings.
Libraries Used:

pandas for data manipulation and cleaning
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib for data visualization
This project demonstrates my ability to perform end-to-end data analysis, from cleaning to visualization, providing actionable insights into movie trends for strategic decision-making.
