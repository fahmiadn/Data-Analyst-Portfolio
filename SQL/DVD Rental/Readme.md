## SQL-Based Data Analysis Project

In this project, I performed data analysis using SQL with PostgreSQL as the database and DBeaver as the GUI. The goal was to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights from the dataset. Key steps included:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilized SQL functions like WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and various JOIN operations to analyze the data comprehensively.

Employed sub-queries to streamline the analysis and improve query efficiency.

### Data Visualization and Presentation:

Exported the analysis results to Excel, where I created visualizations to highlight key findings.

Presented the insights in a structured format, making it easy for stakeholders to understand the data trends and conclusions.

This project demonstrates my SQL proficiency in conducting efficient data analysis and my ability to communicate findings effectively through visualization and presentation.
